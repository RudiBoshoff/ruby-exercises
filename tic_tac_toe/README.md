Project 1: Tic Tac Toe https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop#project-1-tic-tac-toe

Assignment 1
Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.

Think about how you would set up the different elements within the game… What should be a class? Instance variable? Method?
A few minutes of thought can save you from wasting an hour of coding.
Build your game, taking care to not share information between classes any more than you have to.


PROJECT: TESTING YOUR RUBY CODE https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/testing-your-ruby-code

Assignment 2

Write tests for your Tic Tac Toe project. In this situation, it’s not quite as simple as just coming up with inputs and making sure the method returns the correct thing. You’ll need to make the tests determine victory or loss conditions are correctly assessed.

1. Start by writing tests to make sure players win when they should, e.g. when the board reads X X X across the top row, your #game-over method (or its equivalent) should trigger.

2. Test each of your critical methods to make sure they function properly and handle edge cases.

3. Try using mocks/doubles to isolate methods and make sure that they’re sending back the right outputs.

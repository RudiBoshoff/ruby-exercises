Hopefully everyone has played Connect Four at some point (if not, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four). Itâ€™s a basic game where each player takes turns dropping pieces into the cage. Players win if they manage to get 4 of their pieces consecutively in a row, column, or along a diagonal.

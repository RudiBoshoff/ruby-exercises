PROJECT: BUILDING BLOCKS(Caesar's Cipher) https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/building-blocks

Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string:

  > caesar_cipher("What a string!", 5)
  => "Bmfy f xywnsl!"   
  
Quick Tips:

You will need to remember how to convert a string into a number.
Don’t forget to wrap from z to a.
Don’t forget to keep the same case.

Also,
PROJECT: TESTING YOUR RUBY CODE https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/testing-your-ruby-code
Go back to the Building Blocks Project and write tests for your “Caesar’s Cipher” code.
It shouldn’t take more than a half-dozen tests to cover all the possible cases.
